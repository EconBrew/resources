Description and Setup
---------------------
This repository collects resources for the EconBrew presentations. You can run the 
notebooks in here by installing the `econbrew` environment from the environment.yml 
file with anaconda. It is highly recommended to use mamba instead of the standard conda package manager. 
How to set this up you can find [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).
Once set up you can create the environment with the following command:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
If standard anaconda is used, then the following command will do the same:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

How to manage conda environments you can find [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
